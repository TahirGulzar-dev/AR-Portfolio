        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl mt-10">
          As a full-stack developer, I work on both the front-end and back-end
          of web applications to create dynamic and responsive sites that
          provide great user experiences. I use technologies like HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript for the front end to design attractive and interactive
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          For the back end, I work with server-side languages such as Python,
          Ruby, and PHP to build strong and scalable applications. I am skilled
          in using databases and data formats like XML and JSON, which helps me
          manage data effectively and connect with different APIs.
        </p>
        <br />{" "}
        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          I believe in the power of teamwork. I enjoy solving problems and work
          closely with other teams to find creative solutions. Whether Iâ€™m
          working with designers to improve user experience or with product
          managers to meet business goals, I aim to deliver high-quality
          software that goes beyond expectations.
        </p>
        <br />{" "}
        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies
          and am always learning new tools and frameworks to keep up with
          industry changes. My goal is to use my skills in challenging projects
          that can make a difference in technology.
